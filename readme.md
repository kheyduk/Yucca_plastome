Last updated: February 5th, 2020

Data is associated with the following publication:

Heyduk K, et al., **in review**. *Hybridization history and repetitive element content in the genome of a homoploid hybrid, Yucca gloriosa (Asparagaceae).* 


### Files descriptions:

**Yucca_cp_alignment.fa** - Alignment of 38 *Yucca* chloroplast genomes and two outgroup species. 

**Yucca_cp_1IR_align.fa** - Same as above, but with the second inverted repeat region removed. This was the alignment used to make phylogeny below. 

**Yucca_cp_RAxML.tre** - Newick file of the resultant phylogenetic estimate, from RAxML run with 500 bootstrap replicates. Tree is bipartitions file.
